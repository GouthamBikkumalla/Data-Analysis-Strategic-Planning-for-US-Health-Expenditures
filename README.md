Overview

This project aims to predict healthcare costs based on various features like age, sex, bmi, children, smoker status, and region using machine learning models. The notebook healthcare.ipynb outlines the entire process from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains several attributes related to healthcare insurance costs:

Age: Age of the primary beneficiary
Sex: Insurance contractor gender
BMI: Body mass index
Children: Number of children covered by health insurance
Smoker: Smoking status
Region: The beneficiary's residential area in the US
Charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance
Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations to understand the distribution of data and relationships between features.
Model Building: Implementation of various machine learning models including K-nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression.
Model Evaluation: Assessment of models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
Feature Importance: Analysis of the most significant features affecting healthcare costs.
